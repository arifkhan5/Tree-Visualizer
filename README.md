# Tree-Visualizer

Here I am taking the example Tree Visualizer. I have implemented logic with the help of HTML, CSS & JavaScript programming language to make it. You have to give an array, then select Binary Tree Visualization, Max-Heap Visualization and Binary Search Tree Visualization. After selecting these options, the Binary Tree and Array will be appeared. 
Click a value in the binary tree or array to highlight its corresponding location in the dataÂ structure.
